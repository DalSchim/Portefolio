#hellow welcom to my porfolio


## how instal
<br>
to install my portfolio you just have to download it
and store it in a file on your pc.

##languages used
<br>
to make my portfolio I used 3 programming languages
JS, HTML and SCSS.

##how to use  SCSS

to use the SCSS I installed the SASS language and use this command: "sass --watch the file.scss:style.css --style compressed"
this command allows to make a copy of the script in SCSS and to write it in CSS

##how to deploy
for the deployment of my site I used vercel to host it by linking my git hub account.

##add IMGBOT 
I added imgbot which allow to reduce the weight of the image
